# CardCheckerWebsite

**Project Overview:**
- **Purpose:** CardCheckerWebsite is a small static client-side tool to help collectors manage game card lists. It provides utilities to generate a new list, update an existing list after finding cards, compare lists for differences, and host editable FAQ and credits data via JSON files.
- **Tech stack:** Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no build step or server required).

**Quick Start:**
- **Open locally:** Double-click `index.html` in the project root to open the site in your browser. For best behavior and to avoid CORS issues when fetching JSON, serve the folder using a simple static server (examples below).
- **Serve with Python (optional):**
  ```powershell
  cd "d:\My Drive\Websites\New folder\CardCheckerWebsite"
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

**Repository / File Layout:**
- `index.html` : Home page with navigation buttons to the four main tools.
- `style.css` : Site-wide styles and layout rules.
- `js/app.js` : Centralized JavaScript holding all page logic and utilities.
- `pages/` : Directory with the four functional pages:
  - `crea-lista.html` — create/generate a new formatted list from a number (N).
  - `aggiorna-lista.html` — paste an existing list and iteratively update it (mark missing found, add/remove doubles).
  - `compara-lista.html` — paste two lists and compare doubles between them.
  - `faq.html` — FAQ page; content is loaded from `data/faq.json`.
- `data/` : JSON data files used for content-driven pages.
  - `faq.json` — editable FAQ content (array of Q/A entries).
  - `credits.json` — site credits and version displayed in the footer (`#siteCredits`).

**Pages & Features (summary):**
- **Crea Lista** (`pages/crea-lista.html`):
  - Input an integer N to generate a formatted block with:
    - `Carte mancanti:` sequence from 1 to N separated by ` -- `
    - `Carte doppie:` (initially empty)
    - `Ultima modifica:` timestamp
  - Copy-to-clipboard button to copy the formatted list.

- **Aggiorna Lista** (`pages/aggiorna-lista.html`):
  - Paste an existing list (as generated by Crea Lista) and the page will parse `Carte mancanti:` and `Carte doppie:` sections.
  - Controls to mark found missing cards (removes them from `missing`), add doubles (appends to doubles, preserving ordering and duplicates), and remove doubles.
  - Visual, side-by-side view showing Original vs Updated lists. Removed items are highlighted, added items are highlighted; you can click numbers in the original preview to remove them from the updated list.
  - Warnings and validation to avoid adding a double for a card that is still marked missing.

- **Compara Lista** (`pages/compara-lista.html`):
  - Paste list A and list B; click `Calcola Confronto` to compute and present:
    - Doppie in A ma non in B
    - Doppie in B ma non in A
  - Uses Sets so each unique item is reported once, even if present multiple times in the source lists.

- **FAQ** (`pages/faq.html`):
  - FAQ content is stored in `data/faq.json` and loaded at runtime by `js/app.js`. Edit the JSON file to change FAQ entries.

**Data files & editing:**
- To change site credits, edit `data/credits.json`. The site includes a small loader (`loadCredits()`) that populates the footer placeholder element with id `siteCredits`.
- To change FAQ content, edit `data/faq.json`. The site will load the file on page load.

**Key code notes (`js/app.js`):**
- `navigateTo(page)` — (utility) navigate between pages when used from scripts.
- `loadFAQs()` — fetches `data/faq.json` and renders Q/A entries into `#faq-container`.
- `loadCredits()` — fetches `data/credits.json` and writes a formatted credit string into `#siteCredits`.
- `generateList()` — used by Crea Lista to produce the textual list from an integer N.
- `parseSections(text)` — extracts `Carte mancanti:` and `Carte doppie:` sections from pasted list text.
- `renderOutput()` — updates the editable updated list area and original preview (used in Aggiorna Lista).
- `applyFoundMissing()`, `addDoubles()`, `removeDoubles()` — the main operations for updating a pasted list.
- `compareListsUpdate()` — compare logic for Compara Lista.

**Styling notes (`style.css`):**
- The site uses a green top banner with centered heading and button styles for the four main actions. Preview numbers are styled with `.num`, `.num.added`, and `.num.removed` classes to show visual state.

**Development & Contribution:**
- This is a small static project intended to be edited directly. Contributions or changes you might make:
  - Improve copy/paste parsing robustness in `parseSections()` for more edge cases.
  - Replace `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback with the modern Clipboard API across all browsers.
  - Add tests (unit tests for parsing functions) or extract parsing logic into small utilities.

**Analytics / Visit counter (optional):**
- The project currently does not include persistent analytics. If you want a simple visit counter, options include:
  - Google Apps Script + Google Sheets endpoint (serverless, easy to set up).
  - Third-party services that accept POST requests (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
  - A small server endpoint (e.g., a tiny Node/Express or serverless function) to record hits.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If JSON files fail to load when opening pages directly (file://), serve the site with a static server (see Quick Start above).
- Open browser DevTools Console for runtime errors; `js/app.js` logs fetch errors for credits/faq and uses a fallback for credits.

**Contact / Author:**
- Project created by Michele Tunesi — edit `data/credits.json` to change the visible attribution.
